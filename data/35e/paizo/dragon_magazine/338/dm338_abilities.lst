###Block: The Imbued Staff
Cantrips			SORTKEY:The Imbued Staff 02	SOURCEPAGE:p.58	KEY:The Imbued Staff ~ Cantrips			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike		DESC:Three times per day, as a standard action, the wielder of the staff can make it shad a flickering light as per the spell. Once activated, this light remains until the wielder dismisses it (a free action). In addition, the staff can hold a single cantrip available to the wielder, decided upon when it is first imbued. Once per day, as a standard action, the master can cast this cantrip from the staff. The caster level for these effects is equal to that of the master. The save DC for any cantrip cast by the staff is 10.
Deliver Touch Spells	SORTKEY:The Imbued Staff 03	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	KEY:The Imbued Staff ~ Deliver Touch Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The master may deliver touch spells with the staff. When using the staff in this way, the wielder may attempt to deal the staff's damage by hitting the target's standard AC (as opposed to the target's touch AC). A sucessful critical hit with the staff does not double the spell effect when delivered in this way.
Enhanced Weapon		SORTKEY:The Imbued Staff 04	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	KEY:The Imbued Staff ~ Enhanced Weapon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The staff gains the listed enhancement bonus to attack and damage when wielded by its master. This bonus applies to both ends of the staff. In the hands of any other it is merely an ordinary masterwork staff.
Remote Viewing		SORTKEY:The Imbued Staff 05	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	KEY:The Imbued Staff ~ Remote Viewing		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The staff's master may concentrate and view the staff's surroundings as though looking through the finial. This effect is identical to that of clairvoyance except that it lasts for as long as the owner concentrates and has an ininite range so long as the staff is on the same plane. While in effect, the staff's finial glows faintly, illuminating the area around the staff like a candle.
Vital Transfer		SORTKEY:The Imbued Staff 06	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	KEY:The Imbued Staff ~ Vital Transfer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The staff's master may opt to forego her natural healing for the evening and mend her staff through mystical means. Each night's rest thus spent returns a number of hit points to the staff equal to the master's character level, up to the staff's maximum hit points. The Heal skill does not increase this amount.
Perfect Location		SORTKEY:The Imbued Staff 07	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	KEY:The Imbued Staff ~ Perfect Location		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:By concentrating for a full round, the wizard knows the direction and distance to her staff, so long as it is on the same plane.
Mighty Weapon		SORTKEY:The Imbued Staff 08	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	KEY:The Imbued Staff ~ Mighty Weapon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The staff gains the bane, defending, flaming, frost, merciful, shock, or thundering special weapon ability. This ability applies to both ends of the staff. Once chosen, the bonus cannot be changed and does not function in the hands of anyone other than the staff's master.	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Imbued Staff Mighty Weapon Selection|1
Return			SORTKEY:The Imbued Staff 09	SOURCEPAGE:p.60	KEY:The Imbued Staff ~ Return				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The master can summon the staff to her hand as a standard action, so long as it is on the same plane. When summoned in this way, the staff simply appears in its master's hand. Any effect targetting the staff or the master that prevents teleportation also blocks this ability.
