# PCGen-Data
A collection of data taken from [PCGen/PCgen/data](https://github.com/PCGen/pcgen/tree/master/data) and [BahamutDragon/pcgen](https://github.com/BahamutDragon/pcgen).<br><br>
Data in this repo is automatically maintained: updates from the source repos are pulled automatically every day at 5:00am EST.<br><br>
This repo exists to have one repo with all of the most recent sources to be used in conjunction with PCGen. The [Data-Updater](https://github.com/BlyatBeauty/PCGen-Data-Updater) script I wrote uses this repo as its source, ensuring you only download the data you need and not all of PCGen's source code every time you wish to pull new data. However, you may also download this repo manually from GitHub by clicking on the green Code button, then clicking Download ZIP.
<br>You may also use git to pull this repo automatically whenever new updates are pushed to it.<br><br>
<b> Note, this repo will not include [PCGen's New-Sources](https://github.com/PCGen/pcgen-newsources) data packs - as these data packs are considered in progress and incomplete.</b><br><br>
